# Hatsune Miku cursors for Windows/Linux!

![alt text](https://github.com/supermariofps/hatsune-miku-linux-cursors/blob/main/thumb.png?raw=true)

This cursor set is a modified version of a Windows set (containing only the blinking, singing, and sleeping cursors) found [here](https://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=1760192) with the Book and Kotatsu cursors found [here](https://paradise-cheaters.blogspot.com/2014/09/software-cursor-hatsune-miku-pack.html) with a few original ones made by myself!

Unfortunately, I can't confirm the source from any of the 5 original cursors, if you know the original artists behind them please let me know!

Hope you like it!
